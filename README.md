🐍 Python OOP Assignment

This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python, including Classes, Constructors, Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism.

📂 Project Structure

smartphone.py → Example of a custom class (Smartphone) with attributes, methods, inheritance, and encapsulation.

vehicles.py → Polymorphism example with Car, Plane, and Boat, each defining their own move() method.

🚀 Features
Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class

Created a Device base class and a Smartphone subclass.

Demonstrated encapsulation with private attributes (__storage).

Added methods like install_app() and charge() to simulate real actions.

Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge

Implemented a Vehicle base class with subclasses (Car, Plane, Boat).

Each class overrides the move() method differently:

Car.move() → "Driving 🚗"

Plane.move() → "Flying ✈️"

Boat.move() → "Sailing 🚤"
